# Product Requirements Document: Enhanced Results Display for Log Analysis

## Introduction/Overview

This feature enhances the current log analysis results display to provide SOC analysts with a comprehensive, visually appealing, and interactive view of parsed log data and detected anomalies. The current implementation shows basic text-based results; this enhancement will transform it into a professional analyst dashboard with data tables, charts, and clear severity indicators.

**Problem Statement:** SOC analysts need to quickly assess log analysis results, identify critical anomalies, and understand patterns in the data. The current simple text display lacks the visual clarity and interactive capabilities required for efficient threat analysis.

**Goal:** Create a clean, concise, and interactive results dashboard that enables SOC analysts to efficiently review log analysis outcomes and make informed security decisions.

## Goals

1. **Improve Data Comprehension:** Replace basic text display with structured data tables and visual charts
2. **Enable Efficient Analysis:** Provide filtering and sorting capabilities for anomaly management
3. **Enhance Visual Clarity:** Implement color-coded severity indicators (green/yellow/red) for quick threat assessment
4. **Streamline Workflow:** Present high-level metrics in easily digestible card format
5. **Maintain Professional Appearance:** Leverage shadcn components for consistent, modern UI

## User Stories

1. **As a SOC analyst, I want to see high-level summary metrics in card format** so that I can quickly understand the scope of the log analysis (total records, anomaly count, severity breakdown).

2. **As a SOC analyst, I want to view detected anomalies in a sortable data table** so that I can prioritize my investigation based on severity, timestamp, or anomaly type.

3. **As a SOC analyst, I want to filter anomalies by severity level** so that I can focus on the most critical threats first.

4. **As a SOC analyst, I want to see visual charts of anomaly distribution** so that I can identify patterns and trends in the security data.

5. **As a SOC analyst, I want color-coded severity indicators** so that I can immediately distinguish between low, medium, and high-priority anomalies.

6. **As a SOC analyst, I want to sort anomalies by different criteria** so that I can organize the data according to my investigation workflow.

## Functional Requirements

### FR1: Summary Cards Display

- The system must display high-level metrics in card format including:
  - Total records processed
  - Total anomalies detected
  - Breakdown by severity level (High/Medium/Low)
  - Processing timestamp
- Cards must use shadcn Card components with appropriate styling

### FR2: Interactive Data Table

- The system must display anomalies in a sortable data table with columns:
  - Severity (with color indicators)
  - Anomaly Type/Rule
  - Description/Details
  - Line Number
  - Timestamp (if available)
- Table must support sorting on all columns
- Table must use shadcn Table components

### FR3: Filtering Capabilities

- The system must provide filtering options for:
  - Severity level (High/Medium/Low)
  - Anomaly type/rule
- Filters must use shadcn Select or Checkbox components
- Active filters must be clearly visible with ability to clear

### FR4: Visual Charts

- The system must display at least one chart showing:
  - Anomaly distribution by severity (pie or bar chart)
  - Anomaly trends over time (if timestamp data available)
- Charts must use shadcn Chart components (built on recharts) for consistent styling

### FR5: Severity Color Coding

- High severity: Red (#ef4444 or equivalent)
- Medium severity: Yellow/Orange (#f59e0b or equivalent)
- Low severity: Green (#10b981 or equivalent)
- Colors must be applied consistently across all components

### FR6: Responsive Layout

- The system must display properly on desktop screens (primary use case)
- Layout must use shadcn layout components (Grid, Flex) for proper spacing
- Components must be accessible and follow WCAG guidelines

### FR7: Error State Handling

- The system must gracefully handle cases with no anomalies detected
- The system must display appropriate messages for empty or invalid data
- Error states must use shadcn Alert components

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Real-time streaming updates during parsing (separate PRD)
- Deep-dive investigation workflows (separate PRD)
- Export functionality for results
- Historical comparison across multiple uploads
- Advanced analytics or machine learning insights
- Multi-user collaboration features
- Integration with external SIEM systems

## Design Considerations

### Layout Structure

```
┌─ Summary Cards Row ─────────────────────────┐
│ [Total Records] [Anomalies] [High] [Med] [Low] │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
┌─ Controls Row ──────────────────────────────┐
│ [Severity Filter] [Type Filter] [Clear]     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
┌─ Content Row ───────────────────────────────┐
│ ┌─ Data Table ─┐  ┌─ Charts ─────────────┐ │
│ │              │  │                      │ │
│ │ Anomaly List │  │ Severity Distribution│ │
│ │              │  │                      │ │
│ │              │  │ Timeline (if avail.) │ │
│ └──────────────┘  └──────────────────────┘ │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Component Usage

- **Cards:** shadcn Card for summary metrics
- **Table:** shadcn Table with sorting capabilities
- **Filters:** shadcn Select components
- **Charts:** shadcn Chart components (Area, Bar, Pie charts as needed)
- **Layout:** shadcn Grid/Flex utilities
- **Alerts:** shadcn Alert for error states

## Technical Considerations

### Dependencies

- Ensure shadcn/ui components are available and up to date
- Install shadcn Chart components (uses recharts under the hood)
- Leverage existing LogAnalysisResult type definition
- Maintain compatibility with current upload workflow

### State Management

- Extend existing analysisResult state to include severity classification
- Add local state for filtering and sorting preferences
- Consider memoization for performance with large datasets

### Data Processing

- Implement severity classification logic for anomalies
- Add utility functions for data transformation (sorting, filtering)
- Handle edge cases (missing data, malformed results)

## Success Metrics

1. **User Engagement:** SOC analysts spend more time analyzing results vs. scrolling through text
2. **Efficiency:** Reduced time to identify high-priority anomalies (baseline measurement needed)
3. **Usability:** Positive feedback on visual clarity and organization
4. **Functionality:** All filtering and sorting features work reliably across different log sizes
5. **Performance:** Page remains responsive with up to 1000+ anomalies displayed

## Open Questions

1. **Chart Types:** Which specific shadcn chart types work best for anomaly data? (Area charts for trends, Pie charts for distribution, Bar charts for comparisons)
2. **Data Volume:** What's the expected maximum number of anomalies to display?
3. **Severity Classification:** Should severity be determined by anomaly type, or do we need additional logic?
4. **Default Sort:** What should be the default sort order for the anomaly table?
5. **Pagination:** Do we need pagination for large result sets, or is scrolling sufficient?
6. **Mobile Support:** Any requirements for tablet/mobile viewing for SOC analysts?
